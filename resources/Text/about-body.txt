Iâ€™m a high school student, programmer, and efficiency enthusiast! 
With 2 independently published games under my belt, I am actively experimenting and learning new skills to develop interesting games, prototype hardware, and create websites.
Outside from active development, I like to play music, do martial arts, snowboard in the winter, and absorb all kinds of art.
